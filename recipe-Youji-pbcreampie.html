    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul> 
        <li><strong>peanut butter </strong> - I like Jiff Natural</li>
        <li><strong>cream cheese</strong> - I know it seems like a strange combo, but this adds body and richness to the filling without tasting weird or tangy – promise!</li>
        <li><strong>whipped cream</strong> - gives the filling airiness and lightness like a mousse.</li>
        <li><strong>powdered sugar</strong> - sweetens the filling without any graininess</li>
        <li><strong>graham crackers</strong> and <strong>melted butter</strong> - make up the easy crust – it’s a classic for a reason.</li>
        <li><strong>roasted peanuts</strong> - make a great crunchy topping. That little extra hit of salt is perfect</li>
    </ul>

    
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350F.</li>
        <li>In a food processor, blend the graham crackers until finely ground.</li>
        <li>Transfer the crumbs to a bowl and mix with the melted butter until uniform and clumpy.</li>
        <li>Add the crumb mixture to an 9-inch deep dish pie plate. Press them into the bottom and up the sides to form a crust. I like to use a cup measure with a flat bottom to do this.</li>
        <li>Bake the pie crust for 10 minutes, then remove and allow to cool completely.</li>
        <li>To make the peanut butter filling, wipe out your food processor and add the cream cheese, peanut butter, powdered sugar, salt, and vanilla extract to the bowl.</li>
        <li>Process until uniform.</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, whip the heavy cream until stiff peaks form.</li>
        <li>Add the peanut butter mixture, starting with a little bit, to the whipped cream and fold it together until there are no streaks.</li>
        <li>Pour the peanut butter filling into the cooled pie crust, and chill in the refrigerator for at least 3 hours, or up to overnight.</li>
        <li>When ready to serve, whip 1/2 cup cream with the sugar to stiff peaks. Top with the whipped cream and crushed peanuts.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <p>If you’d like to reduce the calories in this dessert, try using low fat cream cheese, and omitting the whipped cream topping.</p>
